# Thor's Codex

Thor's Codex is a project that aims to index all of Pirate Software's available VODs from YouTube and the content of the Discord channel. The project provides a search engine for the words said during these VODs, making it easier to find specific moments and information. In the future, we plan to run a local RAG and LLM to summarize large parts of the VODs. This page hosts the HTML and JavaScript to interact with the application.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Thor's Codex
- **Description**: A static HTML/JS page to host an index of Pirate Software's VODs and Discord content, providing a searchable interface.
- **Future Plans**: Implement a local RAG and LLM to summarize VOD content.

## Features

- Indexes PirateSoftware's YouTube VODs and Discord channel content (only the tts section, soon to be added).
- Provides a search engine to find specific words said during VODs.
- Give context to each search result using an LLM to summerize a portion of the video. 
- This repo is just the static files to host the HTML and JavaScript to interact with the application.

## LLM Summerization
Here is list of what i am currently doing & what i want to do with AI/LLM's in this project. I will do more if i can figure out how to do it cost-effectively. Currently there is over 4m sentences from thor and 100's of hours of video/audio. I may look at local LLM's to do some of the future ideas listed below. 

 - Currently chunking the videos into 30 minute segements for display/performance purposes
 - The LLM is reading the transcript that is generated by YT to make the summary.
 - Future enhancements: LLM Audio transcript - strip out the audio track of each video and send it up to an LLM to do a transcription on that. This will remove the [__] curse filtering that is happening right now. 
 - Future enhancements: Ground the LLM in all of the transcripts and additional info before doing summerization
 - Future enhancements: Improve summaries by running them through different LLM models, to change up the "Same intro every time" to each summary.
 - Future enhancements: Add even more context to summerization by taking out frames of the video and having them parsed and fed into the prompt. 

## Architecture

This system uses a combination of:
- **Static HTML/JS pages** : This repo,  to provide the user interface.
- **[ThorsCodex.Transcripts.to.CSV](https://github.com/Graf3x/ThorsCodex.Transcripts.to.CSV)** : Quick app to gather transcript text.
- **Serverless functions**: API's to route requests and scale based on traffic load. These services will later down-step traffic to different experences for searching based on server load/traffic. Those experences are listed below:

## Searching 

  - **Current Search Experence**: NoSQL DB and a Full Text search, it uses BM25 which from my understanding can not handle multiword phrases. Currently working around this by making "cursed quest" into "cursed" "quest" and saying it needs to find all of the strings.
  - **Advanced Experience**: Uses RAG and LLM to return responses. (Hybrid Search?)
  - **Prime Experience**: Uses asure ai search or elastic/solar or similar tools for searches.
  - **Fallback Experience**: Uses a normal DB search (ie: contains) as an initial, simple fallback.
